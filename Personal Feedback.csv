2025/04/15 9:45:15 pm GMT-4,Very charismatic and loving to people and also a child of God,on your judgement and also how you speak to people and your surroundings!!,"I Love You, and Jesus Loves you and if you step away from His Love you life will be miserable!!!! So Seek Him!!! "

2025/04/15 10:19:52 pm GMT-4,"Grace is a very interesting person. Everyone enjoys having her around. And despite her quiet demeanor, her presence is very loud and is never missed in the room",I think Grace could improve on interpersonal relationships especially with other girls her age. I know itâ€™s probably not easy but I believe if she puts some work into it and actually find sisters for life. Iâ€™m praying for her and I know God will move outside her struggles and make this happen for her.,"Iâ€™m so proud of you and just seeing how youâ€™ve grown so much in the past few years make me so happy. I just want you to know that you donâ€™t have to prove to no one that you are anything (smart, hardworking, etc.) Everything you do, I want it to be everything you wanna do for yourself. I want you to live your own life on your own terms, as long as Godâ€™s hand is on it. Thereâ€™s a lot of confusing things about being in America and theyâ€™ll convince you to believe lies about who you are and even your sexuality, power as a woman, etc. Donâ€™t listen to them. When youâ€™re confused in life about anything, I hope youâ€™ll go to the source of all truth. Youâ€™re a beautiful woman, so never settle for less and fight for attention. What is yours will find you and Godâ€™s timing is the best. Iâ€™m excited to see transform into the beautiful woman I already knew you are. "

2025/04/15 11:38:13 pm GMT-4,"I would describe you as a go getter, unashamedly yourself and a person that makes others feel comfortable. Genuinely always a vibe with your interesting questions. People may think youâ€™re quiet because of how hot speak but youâ€™re not so you just need to SPEAK UPPP.","Maybe not taking things too deep at times. And when you feel off, handling your emotions better so you donâ€™t act in ways that affect the mood of others around you. ",Nopes
2025/04/16 10:20:21 am GMT-4,Very smart and intelligent though timid seems to have a kind heart and not a bad bone in the body ,Maybe social confidence but at this school confidence is something many struggle with so itâ€™s a communal problem most have.,Your very smart and know what your saying and even if you draw a wrong conclusion you drew it logically so donâ€™t be afraid to speak up . Even if you made a mistake you under exactly what your saying be confident in that. Also you have a cool haircut;)
2025/04/16 6:27:54 pm GMT-4,I don't have a description.,"Yes, be more social. (Lemme smash)","Not much, you just need to stop stressing over things and ""enjoy"" life a little. Or you will miss out on many things, you can't have everything, so focus on the present and make the most our of what you have."
2025/04/17 12:45:42 pm GMT-4,Grace Julius is a person I would describe as a ecosystem in herself. She self efficient and ambitious beyond understanding. She carries pride in her heritage and independence. Shes stubborn and that can be good and bad.,"Personally, communication and openness with people who love and want to support her. Also, gifting me the birthday gift she stole.","Yes, its tiring trying to love and care for someone who doesnt understand your efforts because they think its not necessary. You give up on yourself and then shun people from trying to encourage you through support and love. Recieve love because you deserved to be loved."

So keep being you!",You are amazing Grace!
